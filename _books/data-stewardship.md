The purpose of this document is to propose a series of actions to NWO as it formulates its policies on
data-stewardship. The contents of this document are deliberately provocative and formulated to
encourage discussion and the eventual development of an agreed data-stewardship strategy. Above all,
we hope it contributes to a climate in which researchers, funders and administrators recognise that
“taking care of data” is a task for all.
