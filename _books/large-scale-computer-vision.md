The goal of this document is to present a focused partial overview of the state of the art in large
scale computer vision (CV). It aims at identifying areas of expertise in CV which are required
or expected to be required in e-science projects at the Netherlands eScience Center (NLeSC)
as well as defining own research line(s) within the eScience Technology and (applied) research
Platform (eStep) at the NLeSC.
